# Graduation results for Cohorts 2001 to 2011 (Classes of 2005 to 2015) Visuals
# 2020-2021 Demographic Snapshot School Visuals
Data visualizations were created to explore the correlation between features and to identify how one feature may influence another or exhibit high correlation. These visualizations also help detect potential multicollinearity, if present. Some of the graphs created include a scatter plot, bar plot, and a correlation matrix.


Dataset 1: 2020-2021 Demographic Snapshot School Visuals
Correlation Plot
    The correlation plot is a valuable tool for visualizing the relationships between variables and understanding how strongly they are correlated. I also looked at the correlation matrix, where variables with absolute values closer to 1 indicate a strong relationship, while those closer to 0 suggest a weaker correlation.
Correlation Between between # Students with Disabilities and Total Enrollment
    Demonstrating the correlation between students with disabilities and total enrollment. Showing that schools with more students with disabilities tend to have lower enrollment, likely due to limited resources or specialized programs. A few schools with both high disability enrollment and overall size may have more resources to support these students.
Correlation Between between # Students with Disabilities and Total Enrollment
    This scatter plot demonstrates the correlation between % Poverty and Total Enrollment. The points form a consistent horizontal line, indicating a stable pattern where poverty does not have a significant effect on total enrollment.
Dataset 2: Graduation results for Cohorts 2001 to 2011 (Classes of 2005 to 2015) Visuals
    Correlation Plot
    Moving on to the second dataset, I focused on the number of graduates and examined the high correlations between other variables and the number of graduates. I found that '% Total Regents of Cohort', '% Advanced Regents of Cohort', '% Regents without Advanced of Cohort', '% Still Enrolled', and '% Dropout' showed strong correlations. However, some other variables also had high correlations but were removed due to their high dependency on the number of graduates.
Correlation Between between Graduation Rate and # Total Cohort
    This scatter plot demonstrates the relationship between graduation rate and the total number of students in the cohort. From the graph, we can see an increase in total cohort size within the 60-80% graduation rate range, possibly suggesting that schools with higher graduation rates are associated with larger student populations.
Graduation Rates by Borough
    This bar graph shows the graduation rates across different boroughs. Queens has the highest graduation percentage, followed by Staten Island, Manhattan, Citywide, Brooklyn, Other, and the Bronx, which has the lowest graduation rate
