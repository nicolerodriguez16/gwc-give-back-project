# GWC Leadership Academy Give Back Project
 This project was chosen to address the significant disparities in academic performance and educational outcomes among students from different backgrounds/communities in New York City. Growing up ina low-income community and later attending different schools provided me with firsthand insight into how socio-economic factors and school resources can impact educational attainment. 

# Goal:
 The specific intended outcome of this project is to analyze a comprehensive dataset to uncover patterns and correlations that affect academic performance and graduation rates in New York. Machine Learning Algorithims will be implemented (not visible due to code error)
