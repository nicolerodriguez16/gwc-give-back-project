Data Descrption: 
"To provide a snapshot of citywide student enrollment and demographic information across multiple years. Data is collected using multiple data sources, including DOE's Audited Register, biographic data from Automate The Schools (ATS) system and the Location Code Generation and Management System (LCGMS). Data can be used to view citywide demographic and enrollment trends over time. Enrollment counts are based on the October 31 Audited Register for each school year. Please note that October 31 enrollment is not audited for charter schools or Pre-K Early Education Centers(NYCEECs). Charter schools are required to submit enrollment as of BEDS Day the first Wednesday in October to the New York State Education Department of Education. Enrollment counts will exceed operational enrollment counts due the fact that long term absence (LTA) students are excluded for funding purposes."
